FINAL RESULTS:

/home/wallsocket/tty64/sinister/sinister-0.1/src/procfs_read.c:21:  [5] (race) readlink:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files or
  change the link content, a race condition results. Also, it does not
  terminate with ASCII NUL. (CWE-362, CWE-20). Reconsider approach.
/home/wallsocket/tty64/sinister/sinister-0.1/src/gfx.c:38:  [4] (format) vsnprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited,
  and note that sprintf variations do not always \0-terminate (CWE-134). Use
  a constant for the format specification.
/home/wallsocket/tty64/sinister/sinister-0.1/src/process.c:195:  [4] (race) access:
  This usually indicates a security flaw. If an attacker can change anything
  along the path between the call to access() and the file's actual use
  (e.g., by moving files), the attacker can exploit the race condition
  (CWE-362/CWE-367!). Set up the correct permissions (e.g., using setuid())
  and try to open the file directly.
/home/wallsocket/tty64/sinister/sinister-0.1/src/sinister.c:56:  [3] (buffer) getopt:
  Some older implementations do not protect against internal buffer overflows
  (CWE-120, CWE-20). Check implementation on installation, or limit the size
  of all string inputs.
/home/wallsocket/tty64/sinister/sinister-0.1/src/gfx.c:35:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
/home/wallsocket/tty64/sinister/sinister-0.1/src/io.c:26:  [2] (misc) fopen:
  Check when opening files - can an attacker redirect it (via symlinks),
  force the opening of special file type (e.g., device files), move things
  around to create a race condition, control its ancestors, or change its
  contents? (CWE-362).
/home/wallsocket/tty64/sinister/sinister-0.1/src/procfs_read.c:17:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
/home/wallsocket/tty64/sinister/sinister-0.1/src/sinister.c:109:  [2] (integer) atoi:
  Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range
  (CWE-190). If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the
  input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number;
  consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended).
/home/wallsocket/tty64/sinister/sinister-0.1/src/sinister.c:246:  [2] (integer) atoi:
  Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range
  (CWE-190). If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the
  input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number;
  consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended).
/home/wallsocket/tty64/sinister/sinister-0.1/src/sinister.c:248:  [2] (integer) atoi:
  Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range
  (CWE-190). If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the
  input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number;
  consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended).
/home/wallsocket/tty64/sinister/sinister-0.1/src/gfx.c:41:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
/home/wallsocket/tty64/sinister/sinister-0.1/src/gfx.c:43:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
/home/wallsocket/tty64/sinister/sinister-0.1/src/process.c:67:  [1] (buffer) strlen:

/home/wallsocket/tty64/sinister/sinister-0.1/src/process.c:437:  [1] (buffer) strncpy:
  Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for invalid
  pointers [MS-banned] (CWE-120).
/home/wallsocket/tty64/sinister/sinister-0.1/src/process.c:437:  [1] (buffer) strlen:

  a constant for the format specification.
/home/wallsocket/tty64/gizmo/gizmo-0.1/src/misc.c:21:  [4] (misc) getpass:
  This function is obsolete and not portable. It was in SUSv2 but removed by
  POSIX.2. What it does exactly varies considerably between systems,
  particularly in where its prompt is displayed and where it gets its data
  (e.g., /dev/tty, stdin, stderr, etc.). In addition, some implementations
  overflow buffers. (CWE-676, CWE-120, CWE-20). Make the specific calls to do
  exactly what you want. If you continue to use it, or write your own, be
  sure to zero the password as soon as possible to avoid leaving the
  cleartext password visible in the process' address space.
/home/wallsocket/tty64/gizmo/gizmo-0.1/src/asm.c:20:  [3] (random) srand:
